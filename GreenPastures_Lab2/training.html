  <h3>Pasture Board</h3>
   <p> We offer several types of training packages. Whether your horse is completely green,
	   needs a tune up, or is starting in a new discipline,
	   we can customize a training package to meet your needs. </p>
   <h3> Full-Time Training </h3>
	<p> Horses in fulltime training are worked by our trainers five times a week, with goals
		tailored to the owner. Fulltime training includes full-board.  </p>
   <h3> Part-Time Training </h3>
	<p>Horses in part-time training will be worked 3 times a week. Part-time training can be
		packaged with full or partial care board.</p>
   <h3> Individual Training Sessions </h3>
	<p>Individual training sessions are available for both boarders and clients who would like to
		haul in. Individual training sessions are not packaged with board.</p>
